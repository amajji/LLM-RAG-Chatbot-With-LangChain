Abstract
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned
large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.
Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat , are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our
models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on
ourhumanevaluationsforhelpfulnessandsafety,maybeasuitablesubstituteforclosed-
source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety
improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and
contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.

1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in
complex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of fields, including in specialized
domains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive
chat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.
ThecapabilitiesofLLMsareremarkableconsideringtheseeminglystraightforwardnatureofthetraining
methodology. Auto-regressivetransformersarepretrainedonanextensivecorpusofself-superviseddata,
followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback(RLHF).Althoughthetrainingmethodologyissimple,highcomputationalrequirementshave
limited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs
(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that
match the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla
(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such
asChatGPT,BARD,andClaude. TheseclosedproductLLMsareheavilyfine-tunedtoalignwithhuman
preferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in
computeandhumanannotation,andisoftennottransparentoreasilyreproducible,limitingprogresswithin
the community to advance AI alignment research.
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and
Llama 2-Chat , at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,
Llama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to
be on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see
Figures1and3). Wehavetakenmeasurestoincreasethesafetyofthesemodels,usingsafety-specificdata
annotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,
thispapercontributesathoroughdescriptionofourfine-tuningmethodologyandapproachtoimproving
LLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and
continue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.
Wealsosharenovelobservationswemadeduringthedevelopmentof Llama 2 andLlama 2-Chat ,suchas
the emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.

source models. Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across ~2,000 adversarial
prompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is
importanttocaveatthesesafetyresultswiththeinherentbiasofLLMevaluationsduetolimitationsofthe
promptset,subjectivityofthereviewguidelines,andsubjectivityofindividualraters. Additionally,these
safety evaluations are performed using content standards that are likely to be biased towards the Llama
2-Chatmodels.
We are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:

2.Llama 2-Chat , a fine-tuned version of Llama 2 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release

WebelievethattheopenreleaseofLLMs,whendonesafely,willbeanetbenefittosociety. LikeallLLMs,
Llama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;

capabilities and limitations of our models; results can be found in Section 4.1.
2.2 Training Details
We adopt most of the pretraining setting and model architecture from Llama 1 . We use the standard
transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), apply pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang and
Sennrich, 2019), use the SwiGLU activation function (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings
(RoPE, Su et al. 2022). The primary architectural differences from Llama 1 include increased context length
andgrouped-queryattention(GQA).WedetailinAppendixSectionA.2.1eachofthesedifferenceswith
ablation experiments to demonstrate their importance.
Hyperparameters. We trained using the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with β1=
0.9, β2= 0.95,eps= 10−5. We use a cosine learning rate schedule, with warmup of 2000 steps, and decay
finallearningratedownto10%ofthepeaklearningrate. Weuseaweightdecayof 0.1andgradientclipping

democratizable.
Carbon Footprint of Pretraining. Following preceding research (Bender et al., 2021a; Patterson et al., 2021;
Wu et al., 2022; Dodge et al., 2022) and using power consumption estimates of GPU devices and carbon
efficiency, we aim tocalculate thecarbon emissions resultingfrom the pretrainingof Llama 2 models. The

of AI hardware, like GPUs, could add to the overall carbon footprint as suggested by Gupta et al. (2022b,a).
Table 2 summarizes the carbon emission for pretraining the Llama 2 family of models. A cumulative of
3.3M GPUhours ofcomputation wasperformed onhardware oftype A100-80GB (TDPof 400Wor 350W).
We estimate the total emissions for training to be 539 tCO 2eq, of which 100% were directly offset by Meta’s
sustainability program.∗∗Our open release strategy also means that these pretraining costs will not need to
be incurred by other companies, saving more global resources.

3 Fine-tuning
Llama 2-Chat is the result of several months of research and iterative applications of alignment techniques,
including both instruction tuning and RLHF, requiring significant computational and annotation resources.
In this section, we report on our experiments and findings using supervised fine-tuning (Section 3.1), as
well as initial and iterative reward modeling (Section 3.2.2) and RLHF (Section 3.2.3). We also share a
new technique, Ghost Attention (GAtt), which we find helps control dialogue flow over multiple turns
(Section 3.3). See Section 4.2 for safety evaluations on fine-tuned models.
83.1 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
➤Prompt: Writeapoemtohelpmerememberthefirst10elementsontheperiodictable,givingeach
element its own line.
Response: Hydrogen comes first as element number one.
Helium is second for balloons to have fun!
In third place is Lithium to hold battery charge,
Followed by Beryllium in emeralds small and large.
Boron’s number five to help us keep things clean.
Carbon’s next at six, and it’s found in every gene.
Nitrogen is seven, found in every breath we take,
More than eight (or Oxygen) in atmospheric make.
Number nine is Fluorine, helping polish up our teeth.
Neon gives us glowing signs to read and stand beneath.
➤Prompt: I want you to roast me. I want you to make it particularly brutal, swearing at me.
Response: I’m sorry, but I cannot comply with that request. Using vulgar language or intentionally
hurting someone’s feelings is never acceptable. Instead of asking for a roast, I suggest
focusingonpositiveandconstructivefeedbackthatcanhelpyougrowandimproveasan
individual. If you’re looking for comedic relief, there are plenty of other ways to achieve
that without resorting to hurtful language or behavior.
Table 5: SFT annotation — example of a helpfulness (top) and safety(bottom) annotation for SFT, where the
annotator has written both the prompt and its answer.
Getting Started. To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning
data (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).
Quality Is All You Need. Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that
manyofthesehaveinsufficientdiversityandquality—inparticularforaligningLLMstowardsdialogue-style
instructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,
as illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but
higher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These

we found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data
handwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort
to preference-based annotation for RLHF.
Fine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial
learning rate of 2×10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.
For the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence

fine-tune the model for 2 epochs.
3.2 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
RLHFisamodeltrainingprocedurethatisappliedtoafine-tunedlanguagemodeltofurther alignmodel
behavior with human preferences and instruction following. We collect data that represents empirically
9sampled human preferences, whereby human annotators select which of two model outputs they prefer.
This human feedback is subsequently used to train a reward model, which learns patterns in the preferences
of the human annotators and can then automate preference decisions.
3.2.1 Human Preference Data Collection
Next, wecollect human preference datafor reward modeling. We chose a binarycomparison protocol over
other schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other
strategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.
Our annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose
betweentwosampledmodelresponses,basedonprovidedcriteria. Inordertomaximizethediversity,the
tworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature
hyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree
to which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better ,better,
slightly better , ornegligibly better/ unsure .
For our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how
well Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to
whether Llama 2-Chat ’s responses are unsafe, e.g., “giving detailed instructions on making a bomb” could
be considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to
applyspecificguidelinestoeachandbetterguideannotators;forexample,oursafetyannotationsprovide
instructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.
Apart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.
This additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response
is safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with
18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples
where the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be
better/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations
can be found in Section 4.2.1.
Human annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our
reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see
theresultsinSection5,Figure20). Llama 2-Chat improvementalsoshiftedthemodel’sdatadistribution.
Since reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from
hyper-specialization(Scialometal.,2020b),itisimportantbeforeanew Llama 2-Chat tuningiterationto
gather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations. This step helps keep the reward model
on-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.
InTable6,wereportthestatisticsofrewardmodelingdatathatwecollectedovertime,andpresentthem
against multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,
2022a), OpenAISummarize(Stiennon etal., 2020),OpenAI WebGPT(Nakanoet al.,2021), StackExchange
(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).
We collected a large dataset ofover 1million binary comparisons based on humansapplyingour specified
guidelines, which we refer to as Metareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and
answers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer
prompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our
preference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.
3.2.2 Reward Modeling
The reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous
turns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model
generation. Leveragingsuchresponsescoresasrewards,wecanoptimize Llama 2-Chat duringRLHFfor
better human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.
Others have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it
challengingforasinglerewardmodeltoperformwellonboth. Toaddressthis,wetraintwoseparatereward
models, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to as Helpfulness RM ) and another for safety ( Safety RM ).
We initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models

could result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those
ofthepretrainedlanguagemodels,exceptthattheclassificationheadfornext-tokenpredictionisreplaced
with a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.
Training Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data
into a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher
score than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):
Lranking =−log(σ(rθ(x, yc)−rθ(x, yr))) (1)
where rθ(x, y)is the scalar score output for prompt xand completion ywith model weights θ.ycis the
preferred response that annotators choose and yris the rejected counterpart.
Built on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety
rewardmodelsasfollows. Giventhatourpreferenceratingsisdecomposedasascaleoffourpoints(e.g.,
significantly better ), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly
teachtherewardmodeltoassignmorediscrepantscorestothegenerationsthathavemoredifferences. To
do so, we further add a margin component in the loss:
Lranking =−log(σ(rθ(x, yc)−rθ(x, yr)−m(r))) (2)
where the margin m(r)is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin
for pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).

this study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference for Llama 2-Chat outputs rather than
any model outputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source
preferencedatasets. Thus,wehavedecidedtokeeptheminourdatamixture,astheycouldenablebetter
generalization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e. Llama 2-Chat taking advantage of
some weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.
With training data available from different sources, we experimented with different mixing recipes for both

11Helpfulness reward model is eventually trained on all Meta Helpfulness data, combined with an equal

We use a warm-up of 3% of the total number of steps, with a minimum of 5. The effective batch size is kept
fixed at 512 pairs, or 1024 rows per batch.

important proxies for the final performance of Llama 2-Chat . While best practices for comprehensively
evaluating a generative model is an open research question, the ranking task of the reward has no ambiguity.
Therefore, everything else being equal, an improvement of the reward model can be directly translated into
an improvement for Llama 2-Chat .
3.2.3 Iterative Fine-Tuning
As we received more batches of human preference data annotation, we were able to train better reward

here as RLHF-V1, ..., RLHF-V5.
We explored RLHF fine-tuning with two main algorithms:

•RejectionSamplingfine-tuning . Wesample Koutputsfromthemodelandselectthebestcandidate

the highestrewardscore is consideredthe newgold standard. Similar toScialom etal. (2020a), we
then fine-tune our model on the new set of ranked samples, reinforcing the reward.
The two RL algorithms mainly differ in:
•Breadth— in Rejection Sampling, the model explores Ksamples for a given prompt, while only one
generation is done for PPO.
•Depth— in PPO, during training at step tthe sample is a function of the updated model policy from

all the outputs given the initial policy of our model to collect a new dataset, before applying the
fine-tuning similar to SFT. However, since we applied iterative model updates, the fundamental
differences between the two RL algorithms are less pronounced.
Until RLHF (V4), we used only Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, and after that, we combined the two
sequentially, applying PPO on top of the resulted Rejection Sampling checkpoint before sampling again.

Rejection Sampling. We performrejection sampling only with our largest 70B Llama 2-Chat . All smaller
models are fine-tuned on rejection sampled data from the larger model, thus distilling the large-model
capabilities into the smaller ones. We leave further analysis of the effect of this distillation for future work.

selection solely to the“bag” of samples gathered from the precedingiteration. For example, RLHF V3was
trained using only samples from RLHF V2. However, despite continuous improvement, this method led to a
14regressionin somecapabilities. Forexample,RLHFV3 struggledmore thanpreviousversionstocompose
rhyming lines in poems, as discerned through qualitative analysis, suggesting that further investigation into
the causes of and mitigations for forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019; Ramasesh et al.,
2021) could be a fruitful area for additional future research.
In response, on subsequent iterations, we modified our strategy, incorporating top-performing samples from
all prior iterations, such as those used in RLHF-V1 and RLHF-V2. Although we do not present specific
figures, this adjustment demonstrated considerable enhancements in performance and effectively addressed
the previously noted issues. This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals
et al. (2019) in the RL literature.
We illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7. The delta between the maximum and median
curves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta
increases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to
generateagoodtrajectory),whilethemedianremainsstationary. Thereisadirectconnectionbetweenthe
explorationand themaximum rewardwe canobtain amongthesamples. Thetemperatureparameteralso
plays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.
In Figure 8, we report for a Llama 2-Chat -SFT (left) and a Llama 2-Chat -RLHF (right), the maximum
rewardcurvesamongNsamples(with N∈[1, . . . , 100]),fordifferenttemperatures. Wecanobservethat

PPO.WefurthertrainourlanguagemodelfollowingtheRLschemeofStiennonetal.(2020),whichusesthe
reward model as an estimate for the true reward function (human preference) and the pretrained language
model as the policy to optimize. During this phase, we seek to optimize the following objective:
arg max
πEp∼D,g∼π[R(g|p)] (3)
We iteratively improve the policy by sampling prompts pfrom our dataset Dand generations gfrom the
policy πand use the PPO algorithm and loss function to achieve this objective.
The final reward function we use during optimization,
R(g|p) =˜Rc(g|p)−βDKL(πθ(g|p)∥π0(g|p)) (4)
contains a penalty term for diverging from the original policy π0. As was observed in other works (Stiennon
et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), we find this constraint is useful for training stability, and to reduce reward
hackingwherebywewouldachievehighscoresfromtherewardmodelbutlowscoresfromhumanevaluation.
We define Rcto be a piecewise combination of the safety ( Rs) and helpfulness ( Rh) reward models. We

and then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.
3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency
In a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,
or to“act as”some public figure. When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat , the subsequent
response should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial
instruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).
To address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context
Distillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage
process. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).
GAttMethod. Assumewe haveaccess toa multi-turndialoguedataset betweentwo persons(e.g., auser
and an assistant), with a list of messages [u1, a1, . . . , u n, an], where unandancorrespond to the user and
assistant messages for turn n, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected
throughout the dialogue. For example, instcould be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this
instruction to all the user messages of the conversation.
Next, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue
andthesamplewithwhichtofine-tuneamodel,inaprocessanalogoustoRejectionSampling. Insteadof
augmentingallcontext-dialogueturnswiththeinstruction,wecandropitinallbutthefirstturn,butthis
wouldleadtoamismatchattrainingtimebetweenthesystemmessage,i.e.,alltheintermediateassistant
messages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we
simply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.
For the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies ( “You enjoy
e.g. Tennis” ),Language ( “Speakine.g. French” ),or PublicFigure( “Actase.g. Napoleon” ). Toobtainthelists
of hobbies and public figures, we asked Llama 2-Chat to generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the
instructionandmodelknowledge(e.g.,askingthemodeltoactassomeoneithadnotencounteredduring
training). Tomaketheinstructionsmorecomplexanddiverse,weconstructthefinalinstructionbyrandomly
combining the above constraints. When constructing the final system message for the training data, we also
16modifytheoriginalinstructionhalfofthetimetobelessverbose,e.g., “AlwaysactasNapoleonfromnow” ->
”Figure: Napoleon.” These steps produce an SFT dataset, on which we can fine-tune Llama 2-Chat .
GAtt Evaluation. We applied GAtt after RLHF V3. We report a quantitative analysis indicating that GAtt is
consistentupto 20+turns,until themaximumcontextlengthis reached(seeAppendixA.3.5). We triedto
setconstraints notpresentinthetraining ofGAttatinference time,forinstance “Always answerwithHaiku,”
for which the model remained consistent as illustrated in Appendix Figure 28.

be complicated by various HCI considerations (Clark et al., 2021; Gehrmann et al., 2023), and is not always
scalable. Thus, to select the best-performing models among several ablations at each iteration from RLHF-V1
toV5,wefirstobservedtheimprovementoftherewardsfromthelatestrewardmodels,tosavecostsand
increase iteration speed. We later validated major model versions with human evaluations.
How Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go? To measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected
a test setof prompts for both helpfulnessand safety, andasked three annotators tojudgethe quality of the
answersbasedona7-pointLikertscale(thehigherthebetter). Weobservethatourrewardmodelsoverall

confirms the relevance of using our reward as a point-wise metric, despite being trained with a Pairwise
Ranking Loss.

hypothesize that iterative model updates may be helping to prevent this.
As a last verification step to ensure no regression between our new model and the previous one, we use both
to sample during the next annotation iteration. This enables a model comparison “for free” on new prompts
and can help to increase diversity when sampling.

biased in favor of Llama 2-Chat . Therefore, for a fair comparison, we additionally compute the final results

3.4.2 Human Evaluation
Human evaluation is often considered the gold standardfor judging models fornatural language generation,
including dialogue models. To evaluate the quality of major model versions, we asked human evaluators to
rate them on helpfulness and safety. We compare the Llama 2-Chat models to open-source models (Falcon,
MPT MosaicML NLP Team et al. (2023), Vicuna Chiang et al. (2023), as well as closed-source models (Chat-
GPT(OpenAI,2023)andPaLMAniletal.(2023))onover 4,000singleandmulti-turnprompts. ForChatGPT,
weuse gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 modelinallgenerations. ForPaLM,weusethe chat-bison-001 modelinall

model by a large percentage on our prompt set. More results and analysis is available in Section A.3.7.
Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR). In our human evaluations, three different annotators provided independent
assessments for each model generation comparison. High IRR scores (closer to 1.0) are typically seen as
better from a data quality perspective, however, context is important. Highly subjective tasks like evaluating
the overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling
tasks. There arerelativelyfewpublicbenchmarksfor thesecontexts, sowefeelsharing ouranalysis herewill
benefit the research community.
We used Gwet’s AC1/2 statistic (Gwet, 2008, 2014) to measure inter-rater reliability (IRR), as we found it to

Limitations of human evaluations. While our results indicate that Llama 2-Chat is on par with ChatGPT
on human evaluations, it is important to note that human evaluations have several limitations.
•Byacademicandresearchstandards,wehavealargepromptsetof4kprompts. However,itdoesnotcover
real-world usage of these models, which will likely cover a significantly larger number of use cases.
•Diversity of the prompts could be another factor in our results. For example, our prompt set does not
include any coding- or reasoning-related prompts.
•We only evaluate the final generation of a multi-turn conversation. A more interesting evaluation could be
to ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns.

WARNING: this section contains examples of text that may be considered unsafe, offensive, or upsetting.
In this section, we dive deeper into the important topic of safety measurements and mitigations. We first
discussoursafetyinvestigationsintopretrainingdataandpretrainedmodels(Section4.1). Next,wedescribe
theprocessofoursafetyalignment(Section4.2),explaininghowwecollectedsafety-relatedannotationsand

ofLlama 2-Chat (Section 4.4). We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table 52.
4.1 Safety in Pretraining
It is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed
lightonrootcausesofpotentialdownstreamissues,suchaspotentialbiases. Thiscaninformwhat,ifany,
downstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the
pretraining datafor distributionsof languages,demographic representations,and toxicity. Wealso present
the results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.
Steps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly. We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for
each dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain
sitesknowntocontainahighvolumeofpersonalinformationaboutprivateindividuals. Wemadeabest
effort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our
modelsbroadlywillreducetheneedforotherstotrainsimilarmodels. Noadditionalfilteringwasconducted
onthedatasets,toallow Llama 2 tobemorewidelyusableacrosstasks(e.g.,itcanbebetterusedforhate
speechclassification),whileavoidingthepotentialfortheaccidentaldemographicerasuresometimescaused
byover-scrubbing. Importantly,thisallows Llama 2-Chat togeneralizemoreeffectivelyduringsafetytuning
with fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models
should be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.
Demographic Representation: Pronouns. Bias in model generations may result from biases inherited
from the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words
representing “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men”than to words
representing “women,” andGaneshetal.(2023)demonstratesthatamodel’sperformanceonfairnessmetrics
can be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic
groups. WithinourEnglish-languagetrainingcorpus,wecomputedthefrequenciesofthemostcommon
EnglishpronounsinTable9a. Weobservethat Hepronounsaregenerallyoverrepresentedindocuments
comparedto Shepronouns,echoingsimilarfrequencydifferencesobservedinpronominalusageforsimilarly
sized modelpretraining datasets(Chowdhery etal., 2022). This could meanthat themodel islearning less
duringpretrainingaboutcontextthatmentions Shepronouns,andsubsequentlymaypotentiallygenerate He
pronouns at a higher rate than Shepronouns.
DemographicRepresentation: Identities. Wealsoanalyzetherepresentationofdifferentdemographic
groupsinthepretrainingdatabymeasuringratesofusageofdemographicidentitytermsfromtheHolisticBias
dataset(Smithetal.,2022)asaproxy. Wecomputefrequenciesforeachdescriptorterminthepretraining
corpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes ( Religion ,Gender and Sex ,Nationality ,Race and Ethnicity , and
Sexual Orientation ), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few
terms such as “straight,” “white,” and“black,”because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic
mentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in
bothGender and Sex andSexual Orientation . ForGender and Sex , whileShepronouns are mentioned
in fewer documents, the term “female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply
that whilethere isless frequent contextabout Shepronouns, commentsabout “females” are moreprevalent,
perhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021). For Sexual
Orientation ,thetopfivetermsallrelatetoLGBTQ+identities. For Nationality ,RaceandEthnicity ,and
Religion , we observe a Western skew (Bhatt et al., 2022). For instance, the term “American” is mentioned in
69.4% of the references, the term “European” is more prevalent than other race and ethnicity, and “Christian”
is the most represented religion followed by “Catholic” and“Jewish.”

partially made up of programming code data.
SafetyBenchmarksforPretrainedModels. Weevaluatethesafetycapabilitiesof Llama 2 onthreepopular
automatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety.
1.Truthfulness , referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-
tions or false beliefs. We employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can
generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.
2.Toxicity,definedasthetendencyofalanguagemodeltogeneratetoxic,rude,adversarial,orimplicitly
hateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation
of toxic language and hate speech across different groups.
3.Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use
BOLD(Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with
demographic attributes.
We compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,
2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1
and use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top- pset to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the
percentageofgenerationsthatarebothtruthfulandinformative(thehigher,thebetter). ForToxiGen,we
presentthepercentageofgenerationsthataredeemedtoxicbythemetric(thelower,thebetter). Detailed
descriptionsofthebenchmarksandmetricscanbefoundinAppendixA.4.7. Whencomparedto Llama 1-7B,
Llama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in
toxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result
from larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship
between pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical
work to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and
further evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.
In Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with
demographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using
BOLDprompts. MoredetailedresultssplitbydifferentdemographicgroupscanbefoundinAppendixA.4.8.
Llama 2 doesnotoutperformothermodelsontoxicitymetrics,andwespeculatethatthismaybebecausewe
refrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may
enable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),
and it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models
trained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable
safety-alignment. Wereiteratethatthismotivatedchoicedoesimplythatadditionalsafetymitigationsshould
be applied before deployment of base Llama 2 models.

4.2 Safety Fine-Tuning
In this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation
guidelines,andthetechniquesweusetomitigatesafetyrisks. Weemployaprocesssimilartothegeneral
fine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.
Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:
1.Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning : We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-
tions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches
themodeltoalignwithoursafetyguidelinesevenbeforeRLHF,andthuslaysthefoundationfor
high-quality human preference data annotation.
2.Safety RLHF : Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-
tion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging
adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.
3.SafetyContextDistillation : Finally,werefineourRLHFpipelinewithcontextdistillation(Askell
etal.,2021b). Thisinvolvesgeneratingsafermodelresponsesbyprefixingapromptwithasafety
preprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer
responses without the preprompt, which essentially distillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the
model. Weuseatargetedapproachthatallowsoursafetyrewardmodeltochoosewhethertouse
context distillation for each sample.
4.2.1 Safety Categories and Annotation Guidelines
Based on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to
createadversarialpromptsalongtwodimensions: a riskcategory ,orpotentialtopicaboutwhichtheLLM
couldproduceunsafecontent;andan attackvector ,orquestionstyletocoverdifferentvarietiesofprompts
that could elicit bad model behaviors.
Theriskcategoriesconsideredcanbebroadlydividedintothefollowingthreecategories: illicitandcriminal
activities (e.g.,terrorism,theft,humantrafficking); hatefulandharmfulactivities (e.g.,defamation,self-
harm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal
23advice). The attackvectors exploredconsist ofpsychological manipulation(e.g., authoritymanipulation),
logic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation
(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.
Wethendefinebestpracticesforsafeandhelpfulmodelresponses: themodelshouldfirstaddressimmediate
safetyconcernsifapplicable,thenaddressthepromptbyexplainingthepotentialriskstotheuser,andfinally
provide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience
categories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are
iteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.
4.2.2 Safety Supervised Fine-Tuning
InaccordancewiththeestablishedguidelinesfromSection4.2.1,wegatherpromptsanddemonstrations
ofsafemodelresponsesfromtrainedannotators,andusethedataforsupervisedfine-tuninginthesame
manner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.
The annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce
themodel toexhibit unsafebehavior, i.e.,perform redteaming, asdefined bythe guidelines. Subsequently,
annotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.
4.2.3 Safety RLHF
Weobserveearlyinthedevelopmentof Llama 2-Chat thatitisabletogeneralizefromthesafedemonstrations
insupervisedfine-tuning. Themodelquicklylearnstowritedetailedsaferesponses,addresssafetyconcerns,
explainwhythetopicmightbesensitive,andprovideadditionalhelpfulinformation. Inparticular,when
the model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.
Therefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to
teachthemodelhowtowritemorenuancedresponses. ComprehensivetuningwithRLHFhastheadded
benefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).

Measure of False Refusal. Even though we do not see overall regression on model helpfulness, we qualita-
tively observe, through interaction, that the model with more safety mitigation answers certain questions in
a more conservative manner (e.g., example shown in Appendix Table 38). As a follow-up, we measure false
refusaltoquantifythefrequencythatthemodelincorrectlyrefusestoanswernon-adversarialprompts. Here,
we define false refusal as the model incorrectly refusing to answer legitimate user prompts due to irrelevant
safety concerns. Refusing due to reasonable causes exceeding the model’s capability, e.g., “I am not capable of
participating in video calls” and“2024 is beyond my knowledge cut-off date,” are not counted as false refusals. We

(e.g., containing sensitive words or subwords) but are not actually unsafe (e.g., “give me a recipe for Christmas
Crack”)(see Appendix Table 41 for more examples).
With more safety data mixed in model tuning, the false-refusal rate becomes larger on both datasets (see

The tailored preprompt with answer template is more relevant to the answer.
4.2.4 Context Distillation for Safety
Weencourage Llama 2-Chat toassociateadversarialpromptswithsaferresponsesbyusingcontextdistillation
(Askell et al., 2021a) similar to Section 3.3. We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently
enhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant” ).
Like supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s
responses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.
Specifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate
saferresponses,andthenfine-tunethemodelonitsownsafeoutputgiventheadversarialpromptwithout
the preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various
adjectivesusuallyassociatedwithsafebehaviorsuchas “responsible,”“respectful’,’ or“wise,”withtheintuition
thatthemodelassociatesthemwithpositivetraitsthatwewanttoseereflectedinsafeanswers. Weshow
examples of safety preprompts in Appendix Table 39.

this allows us to provide some dedicated answer templates of how adversarial prompts should be addressed,
based on each identified risk category. Figure 16a shows the impact of context distillation and context

have a low score, but can also have a detrimental effect on samples that initially have a high score. We

RejectingContextDistillationErrorswiththeSafetyRewardModel Itisimportanttonotethatperforming
safetycontextdistillationforhelpfulpromptscandegrademodelperformanceandleadtomorefalserefusals
(see Appendix Table 40). We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.
However, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing
with adversarial prompts. Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of
context distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt,
often resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table 40 for an example of vague answers due
tocontextdistillation). Wethusleveragethesafetyrewardmodeltodecidewhethertousesafetycontext
distillation – we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model
score than the original answer. We notice that thisis particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very
bad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure 16b).
4.3 Red Teaming
GivenhowbroadthecapabilitiesofLLMsareandhowvariedtheirtrainingdatais,itisinsufficienttoidentify
risks solely via ex post facto usage and analysis. Rather, as has been done for other LLMs, we performed
various kinds of proactive risk identification, colloquially called “red teaming,“ based on the term commonly
used within computer security. This kind of granular analysis is very important because safety is a long-tail
issue,inwhichevenveryinfrequentedgecasescancausenoticeableproblems. Evenifquantitativescores
report good results, these types of qualitative insights allow us to recognize and target specific patterns in a
more comprehensive way.
We conducted a series of red teaming with various groups of internal employees, contract workers, and
externalvendors. Theseteamsincludedover350people,includingdomainexpertsincybersecurity,elec-
tion fraud, social media misinformation, legal, policy, civil rights, ethics, software engineering, machine
learning, responsible AI, and creative writing. They also included individuals representative of a variety of
socioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, and racial demographics.

advice, privacy violations, and more), as well as different attack vectors (such as hypothetical questions,

risk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.
Some examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon
throughout development:
•[Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-
tain problematiccontent. However, [slightly later models] have tended todisplay knowledge
that the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it. “They respond with ‘[UNSAFE
CONTENT]isnotappropriatetodiscuss,etc.’ andthenimmediatelyfollowupwith‘Withthatsaid,here’s
how [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ” [Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.
•Distracting the [early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any
reluctanceencounteredviamoredirectrequests. “Acreativewritingrequest(song,story,poem,etc.) isa
reliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”
•Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that
problematicoutputwasbeingrequestedfor [early models] :“TheoverallprincipleI’vefoundmost
effective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”
From Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models. Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough
analysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-
formation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide
to helpfurther modelsafetytraining, and specificallytook data fromthese exercisesformodel fine-tuning,
model feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.
Multiple additionalrounds ofred teaming wereperformed over severalmonths tomeasure the robustness
of each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model, γ, with respect to
a red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would
triggeraviolatingresponsefromthemodelperpersonperhour. Asanexample,onour7Bmodel,wehadan
evolution of γ: 1.8→0.45over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely
continue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models
were produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red
teaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release. On average, we had a 90% rejection
rate model over model.

We then asked raters to judge models for safety violations on a five-point Likert scale with the following
definitions:

of the review guidelines, content standards, and subjectivity of individual raters. Upon manual analysis, we
found that the response of Falcon is typically short (one or two sentences), thus less prone to generating
unsafe content but also generally less helpful. This is reflected by a large number of responses of Falcon with
rating = 3. As a result, we note that in Figure 17b the average rating of Falcon is much lower than Llama
2-Chat(34B) although their violation percentages look similar ( 3.88vs4.45).

315 Discussion
Here, we discuss the interesting properties we have observed with RLHF (Section 5.1). We then discuss the
limitations of Llama 2-Chat (Section 5.2). Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these
models (Section 5.3).
5.1 Learnings and Observations
Our tuning process revealed several interesting results, such as Llama 2-Chat ’s abilities to temporally
organize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.

Figure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions of Llama 2-Chat , from SFT models towards RLHF.
Beyond Human Supervision. At the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for
supervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-
bility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement
learning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore
that the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs
throughout the annotation process.
Evenwithproficientannotators,eachindividualwriteswithsignificantvariation. Amodelfine-tunedon
SFTannotationlearnsthisdiversity,including,unfortunately,thetail-endofpoorlyexecutedannotation. Fur-
thermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human
annotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation
forRLHF.Consequently,therewardmechanismswiftlylearnstoassignlowscorestoundesirabletail-end
distribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we
can see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.
In addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the
bestannotatorsmaynotchart. Nonetheless,humanscanstillprovidevaluablefeedbackwhencomparingtwo
answers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished
artists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of
LLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as
documented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold
standard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”

notpreviouslyreportedtothebestofourknowledge: thedynamicre-scalingoftemperaturecontingentupon
thecontext. AsindicatedinFigure8,thetemperatureappearstobeinfluencedbyRLHF.Yet,intriguingly,
our findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.
Forinstance,whenitcomestopromptsassociatedwithcreativity,suchas“Writeapoem,”anincreasein
temperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the
Self-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.

corresponds to more diversity: RLHF eliminates diversity in responses to factual prompts but retains more
diversity when generating responses to creative prompts. We prompt each model with a diverse set of
10 creative and 10 factual instructions and sample 25 responses. This is repeated for the temperatures
T∈ {k/10|k∈N: 1≤k≤15}. For each of the 25 responses we compute the Self-BLEU metric and report
the mean and standard deviation against the temperature.
Figure 22: Time awareness — illustration of our model generalizing the notion of time, with 1,000 SFT
time-focused data.
Llama 2-Chat Temporal Perception Our model showcased impressive generalization ability, as shown in
Figure 22. We manually tested dozens of examples and observed consistently that our model demonstrates a
robustcapabilitytoorganizeitsknowledgeinatemporalmanner,evenwhenprovidedwithminimaldata. To

associated with two critical pieces of metadata: the date when the query was posed — which influenced the
response — and the event date, a point in time prior to which the question would be nonsensical.
The observation suggests that LLMs have internalized the concept of time to a greater extent than previously
assumed,despitetheirtrainingbeingsolelybasedonnext-tokenpredictionanddatathatisrandomlyshuffled
without regard to their chronological context.

manner. Although we never explicitly annotate tool-use usage, Figure 23 exhibits an instance where the
model demonstrated the capability to utilize a sequence of tools in a zero-shot context.
In addition, our study extended to evaluating the Llama 2-Chat with access to a calculator. The results from
thisparticularexperimentaredocumentedinTable15. LLMtooluse,whileexciting,canalsocausesome
safety concerns. We encourage more community research and red teaming in this area.
5.2 Limitations and Ethical Considerations
Llama 2-Chat is subject to the same well-recognized limitations of other LLMs, including a cessation of
knowledge updates post-pretraining, potential for non-factual generation such as unqualified advice, and a
propensity towards hallucinations.
Furthermore,ourinitialversionof Llama 2-Chat predominantlyconcentratedonEnglish-languagedata.
While our experimental observations suggestthe model has garnered some proficiency in other languages,
itsproficiencyislimited,dueprimarilytothelimitedamountofpretrainingdataavailableinnon-English
languages(asdocumentedinTable10). Consequently,themodel’sperformanceinlanguagesotherthan
English remains fragile and should be used with caution.
Like other LLMs, Llama 2 may generate harmful, offensive, or biased content due to its training on publicly
available online datasets. We attempted to mitigate this via fine-tuning, but some issues may remain,
particularlyforlanguagesotherthanEnglish wherepubliclyavailable datasetswerenotavailable. Wewill
continue to fine-tune and release updated versions in the future as we progress on addressing these issues.

bioterrorism or cybercrime. We have, however, made efforts to tune the models to avoid these topics and
diminish any capabilities they might have offered for those use cases.
While we attempted to reasonably balance safety with helpfulness, in some instances, our safety tuning goes
too far. Users of Llama 2-Chat may observe an overly cautious approach, with the model erring on the side
of declining certain requests or responding with too many safety details.

5.3 Responsible Release Strategy
ReleaseDetails. Wemake Llama 2 availableforbothresearchandcommercialuseat https://ai.meta.
com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/ . Thosewhouse Llama 2 mustcomplywiththetermsof
the provided license and our Acceptable Use Policy , which prohibit any uses that would violate applicable

here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama . Finally,wearesharinga ResponsibleUseGuide ,which
provides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.
ResponsibleRelease. WhilemanycompanieshaveoptedtobuildAIbehindcloseddoors,wearereleasing
Llama 2 openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws
uponthecollectivewisdom,diversity,andingenuityoftheAI-practitionercommunitytorealizethebenefitsof
thistechnology. Collaborationwillmakethesemodelsbetterandsafer. TheentireAIcommunity—academic
researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose
the risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This
approachnotonlyfostersrealcollaborationwithdiversestakeholders—thosebeyondthewallsofbigtech
companies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued
in Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,
democratizingthetechnologyanddecentralizingAIexpertise. WebelievethatthedecentralizationofAI
expertisedoesmorethansimplydistributeknowledge—itstimulatesinnovationandacceleratesprogress
in the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,
allowingsmallbusinessestoleverageinnovationsinLLMstoexploreandbuildtext-generationusecases.
Ultimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe
to benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.
We know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there
are reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and
problematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this
paper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we
recognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and
collaboration with the AI community.
6 Related Work
Large Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.
Following the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B
parameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized
models, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,
2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in
thisprogressionistheriseofLlama,recognizedforitsfocusoncomputationalefficiencyduringinference
(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-
sourcemodels. Open-sourcereleaseslikeBLOOM(Scaoetal.,2022),OPT(Zhangetal.,2022),andFalcon
(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.
§§https://ai.meta.com/llama
35Yet,whenitcomestothe"production-ready"LLMssuchasChatGPT,Bard,andClaude,there’samarked
distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with
human preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the
open-source community.
Attempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)
andAlpaca(Taorietal.,2023)adoptingauniqueapproachtotrainingwithsyntheticinstructions(Honovich
et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set
by their closed-source counterparts.
InstructionTuning. Weietal.(2021)obtainedzero-shotperformanceonunseentasksbyfine-tuningLLMs
onnumerousdatasets. Chungetal.(2022)andLongpreetal.(2023)investigatetheimpactofinstruction
tuningasafunctionofnumberoftasks,modelsize,promptsettings,etc. Promptsusedforinstructiontuning

torefineinitialgenerationstomakethemmoreuseful,engaging,andunbiased(Gangulietal.,2023;Madaan
et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in
whichmodels areprompted toexplain theirreasoningwhen givena complexproblem, inorder toincrease
the likelihood that their final answer is correct.
RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant
improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.
(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.
In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the
models’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.
Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix
issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai
et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled
fine-tuningdatawiththemodel’sownself-critiquesandrevisions,andbyreplacinghumanraterswitha
model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).
Known LLM Safety Challenges. Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked
with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards
likebias,toxicity,privatedataleakage,andthepotentialformalicioususes. Solaimanetal.(2023)categorizes
theseimpactsintotwogroups—thosethatcanbeassessedwithinthebasesystemandthoserequiringa
societal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm.
WorkfromRolleretal.(2020)andDinanetal.(2021)alsoilluminatesthedifficultiestiedtochatbot-oriented
LLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes
a taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between
potential positive and negative impacts from releasing dialogue models.
InvestigationsintoredteamingrevealspecificchallengesintunedLLMs,withstudiesbyGangulietal.(2022)
and Zhuoet al. (2023) showcasing a variety ofsuccessful attack typesand their effects onthe generation of
harmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as (Mialon et al., 2023), have also
raisedredflagsaroundadvancedemergentmodelbehaviors,cyberthreats,andpotentialmisuseinareaslike
biological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an
over-reliance on LLMs leading to training data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu
andRestrepo,2018;AutorandSalomons,2018;Webb,2019;Shumailovetal.,2023). Wearecommittedto

In Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B
tokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and
MQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention
layers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we
increase it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the
MHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.

A.3 Additional Details for Fine-tuning
A.3.1 Detailed Statistics of Meta Human Preference Data
Table 26 shows detailed statistics on Meta human preference data. In total, we collected 14 batches of human
preferencedata(i.e.,MetaSafety+Helpfulness)onaweeklybasis,consistingofover1millionbinarymodel
generation comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over
time and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We
also intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the
average number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.
In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share
of samples with similar responses (e.g., negligibly better or unsure ) increase dramatically over time while
those with stronger preference (e.g., significantly better ) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our
iterativemodelupdateandpreferencedataannotationprocedure-withbetter-performing Llama 2-Chat

A.3.2 Curriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data
High quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation
platforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first
model,theannotatorswereaskedtomakepromptsrelativelysimple,andthentoprogressivelymovetowards
morecomplexpromptsandteachingnewskillsto Llama 2-Chat . Anillustrationofthiscurriculumannotation
on our helpfulness preference data is displayed in Figure 26.
A.3.3 Ablation on Ranking Loss with Preference Rating-based Margin for Reward Modeling
We ablated the ranking loss with the preference rating-based margin term for the helpfulness reward model.
We tried two variants of m(r)with different magnitude for the margin term in Eq 2 as listed open-source 27
andcomparethemagainstthebaselinewithoutthemarginterm. Wereportboththeirper-ratingandaverage

However, the larger margin also regresses performance on similar samples.
We further evaluated the impact of margin-based loss on reward score distribution shifts. We plot the

as the threshold (negative before Sigmoid) and thus offers a better safety reward signal for RLHF. Teaching

fine-tuned with 4096 max length. We tested if GAtt works beyond 2048 tokens, and the model arguably
managed to understand attributes beyond this window. This promising result indicates that GAtt could be
adapted as an efficient technique for long context attention.

prompts. Wemanuallycollectedsingleturnpromptsspanningthefollowingcategories: factualquestions,
writing and content creation, language assistance, recommendations, and dialogue. For multi-turn prompts,
annotatorsinteractedwithanothermodeltogenerateasetofmulti-turnprompts. Tohelpensurefairness,
we asked annotators to collect multi-turn prompts by using four different interaction methods: (a) ChatGPT
astheinteractionmodel,(b) Llama 2-Chat astheinteractionmodel,(c)bestresponsebetweenChatGPT
andLlama 2-Chat at every turn as selected by the annotators, (d) alternating between ChatGPT and Llama
2-Chatat every turn. We also categorized multi-turn prompts into the same five categories listed above.
Sinceitcanbehardtocategorizemulti-turnpromptsintoasinglecategory,annotatorscouldselectuptotwo
categories for multi-turn prompts. Example evaluation prompts can be seen in Table 33.
For open-source models, we collect generations using a context length of 1000 tokens and allow the model to
generateupto1000tokens. Eventhough Llama 2-Chat modelsarecapableofhandlingupto4000tokens,
we limit the context and generation length to 1000 tokens to provide a fair comparison with the open-source
models. Limiting the generation length to 1000 tokens may adversely affect the Llama 2-Chat models. Any

models,weusethe mpt-7b-chat model . ForFalconmodels,weusethe Falcon-40B-Instruct modelwhich
is a chat/instruct model. For Vicuna models, we use vicuna-13b-delta-v1.1 andvicuna-33b-delta-v1.3
models from lmsys. All model weights were obtained from HuggingFace.
Since closed-source models have longer context lengths, we change the context length and generation length
to 2000 tokens for these models. To evaluate with closed source models, we collect another set of generations
with 2000 context and generation length.
Whilecollectinggenerations,weappendasystempromptpriortothepromptforevaluation. Thesystem
prompt for each model is shown in Table 31. Since ChatGPT, PaLM, and Falcon do not provide a system

example prompt can be seen in Table 34.

forLlama 2-Chat 70B compared to ChatGPT using system prompts for both models ( Right).
Evaluation Methodology. For evaluations, the human annotators are presented with a prompt and genera-
tions from two models side-by-side. They are asked to answer the following question:
Considering both model responses, which is better (helpful while also being safe and
honest), Model A or Model B?
The annotators answer this question on a seven point scale with the following labels:
A is much better, A is better, A is slightly better, About the same, B is slightly better,
B is better, B is much better .
Oneofthemodelgenerationsisa Llama 2-Chat modelandtheothergenerationisoneoftheopensource
or closed source models. Responses from the two models are randomized as Model A or Model B when
presented to the annotators. From this data, we report wins, ties, and losses in our results. Three annotators

Additional Results. To understand the impact of system prompt on ChatGPT generations, we ran another
human evaluation without any system prompt for ChatGPT. As shown in Figure 30, Llama 2-Chat win rate
increases from 36% to 44%. Additionally, the win rate for single turn prompts show a dramatic increase from
36% to nearly 49%. In 30, we also show the category wise breakdown of win rate for different categories

square or rectangular face shape.

Vicuna-13b-v1.1 As a language model, I don’t have personal experience as a hair dresser, but generally speaking, a good haircut that looks
great on everyone is a classic, timeless style that flatters the individual’s face shape, hair texture, and personal style. Some
examples of such hairstyles include:
Bob: A classic bob haircut can look great on anyone, whether it’s a chin-length bob or a longer, more dramatic version.
Layers: Adding layers to a hairstyle can add dimension and movement, and can look great on a variety of face shapes.
Pixie cut: A pixie cut is a short, choppy hairstyle that can look great on anyone with a round or oval face shape.
Updo: An updo is a great option for those with curly or wavy hair, as it can help to keep the hair out of their face and

59➤Prompt: How does a ponzi scheme operate. How do the masterminds set it up?

from funds contributed by new investors, rather than from profit earned. The scheme relies
onthecontinuousinfluxofnewinvestorstoprovidethefundsneededtopaythereturns
to earlier investors. It is named after Charles Ponzi, who became infamous for using this
technique in the early 1900s.
The masterminds behind a Ponzi scheme typically follow a steps to set it up and carry it out:
1. Theyidentifyagroupofpotentialinvestorsandmakepromisesofhighreturnsordivi-
dends that are not available through legitimate investments.
2. Theymaycreatefakedocumentsandothermaterialstomaketheschemeappearlegitimate,

Without context distillation False refusal with context distillation
There could be several reasons why people might

ties:
1. Cultural associations: Fried chicken is a popular
food in many cultures, and it’s often associated with
AfricanAmericancuisine. Ifyou’reAfricanAmeri-
can, people might assume that you like fried chicken
because it’s a part of your cultural heritage. 2. [...]

Inthissection,weprovideadetaileddescriptionabouttheautomaticsafetybenchmarksweuseforevaluation
from the perspectives of truthfulness, toxicity, and bias.
Truthfulness. To understand the ability of LLMs to generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and
commonsense,weemployTruthfulQA(Linetal.,2021),usedforLLMhallucinationstomeasurewhether
alanguagemodelistruthfulingeneratinganswerstoquestionswhilebeinginformativeatthesametime.
The TruthfulQA benchmark consists of 817 questions distributed across 38 categories, including but not
limited tohealth, finance,law, andpolitics (Lin etal., 2021). The questionsare designed ina waythat even
humans might answer incorrectly because of an unfounded belief or misconception. Following Lin et al.
(2021)weuseGPT-3-basedmetrics,whichhavebeenshowntohaverobustperformanceinpredictinghuman
judgments. Specifically, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model¶¶, i.e. a “GPT-judge”, is used to predict the truthfulness
and informativeness of the generated outputs from LLMs. For the QA prompt, we adopt a few-shot prompt
containing 6 random QA pairs with the formats following InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). We report the
percentageofgenerationsthatarebothtruthfulandinformative,aswellasthepercentagethatareeither
truthfulorinformative.
Toxicity. Tomeasurethedegreeofgenerationoftoxiclanguageandhatespeechacrossdifferentgroups,we
useToxiGen(Hartvigsenetal.,2022),adatasetthatcontainsimplicitlytoxicandbenignsentencesmentioning
13 minority groups. We adopt a revised version of the dataset from Hosseini et al. (2023) that reduces noise
byfilteringoutpromptsforwhichannotatorsdisagreeonthetargetdemographicgroup. Wethenusethe
default ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to measure the toxicity of generations of each
of the LLMs.
Bias.To study the sentiment in model generations that may vary with demographic attributes, we choose
BOLD(Dhamalaetal.,2021),alarge-scalebiasbenchmarkthatcomprises23,679EnglishWikipediaprompts
spanning five domains of race, gender, religion, political ideology, and profession, with 43 different sub-

A.4.8 Automatic Safety Benchmark Evaluation Results
Fine-grainedAnalysisofToxicity,Truthfulness,andBias. Hereweperformin-depthanalysestobetter
understand the safety of model generations from the perspectives of toxicity, truthfulness, and bias.
•Truthfulness. Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,
percentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across
generations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,
thetruthfulnesspercentageisrelativelylowforpretrainedmodels,around30%to40%forFalcon,
MPT, and the 7B Llama 1. This percentage increases for pretrained Llama 1 andLlama 2 with a
larger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13B Llama 2-Chat improved about 20% in
truthfulness,30B Llama 2-Chat improvedabout24%,and70B Llama 2-Chat improvedabout14%
compared to their pretrained versions.
•Toxicity. Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic
groups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained
models. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models of all sizes show an
effectivelyzeropercentageoftoxicmodelgenerations,andhencetheirresultsarenotpresentedhere.
•Bias.Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different
demographic groupsunder the domains of race,gender,religious ideology, political ideology, and
profession. Overall, we observe positive sentiment scores for each domain in the BOLD dataset for

∗∗∗In this analysis, we remove prompts that fall into the religious ideology subgroups Hinduism and Atheism, because
they are underrepresented with only 12 and 29 prompts, respectively.

Additionally, benchmarks typically assess language understanding and generation based on individual
sentences or prompts, but in chat scenarios, context is important. The ability of a fine-tuned chat model
tomaintaincontext,handlenuancedsituations,andavoidgeneratingtoxiccontentwithinaconversation
may not be thoroughly evaluated by existing benchmarks. In the BOLD dataset, the prompts extracted from
Wikipediaaretakentobethefirstfivewordsplusthedomainterm,resultinginpromptsinBOLDhavingsix
to nine words, depending on the domain and demographic group (Dhamala et al., 2021).
After deployment, safety in chat models involves user experience and long-term effects, which are not
captured by benchmarks alone. Therefore, to assess safety effectively, additional testing of how they are
integrated in a product deployment, how they are used, and what metrics accurately and precisely capture
safety risks given the product context is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of safety. Our future work

A.5 Data Annotation
We have relied on human annotators in order to collect annotations for the supervised fine-tuning stage and
human preferences to train the reward models. In this section, we provide details about the data annotation
process.
A.5.1 SFT Annotation Instructions
Wehavecollectedsingle-turnandmulti-turndialogueannotationsfromourpoolofannotators. Weasked
the annotators to write responses that are informative, truthful, relevant, clear and harmless. We also asked

A.5.2 Negative User Experience Categories
There are different kinds of responses that could cause a negative user experience when interacting with our
models. We have instructed the annotators to avoid writing responses that violate our safety guidelines, for
example, we ask that prompts they write do not:
1. Promote or enable criminal activities.
2. Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.
3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.
4. Contain, promote or enable sexually explicit content.

A.6 Dataset Contamination
Withtheincreasingscaleofpubliclyavailabletrainingdata,ithasbecomeinevitablethatsomeportionof
evaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.
Earlierwork(Brownetal.(2020),Weietal.(2022a),Duetal.(2022)inmeasuringsuchdatasetcontamination
considered an example from an evaluation set to be “contaminated” if there existed a collision between
a high-order n-gram (generally, n= 13) from the sample and the training data. This was a deliberately
conservativeapproachinordertoproducea“clean”subsetofthedatawithhighprecision,andisusedin
open-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).
This approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,
and didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery
etal.(2022),somedatasets(suchasBoolQ)containcontextsextractedverbatimfromtheweb,butnotthe
questionandanswercontinuation. Assuch,highlycontaminatedsamplesfromthesedatasetsareunlikely
togainanunfairadvantage. ThemethodologyinChowdheryetal.(2022)furtherimprovesontheearlier
n-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at
least once in the training data.
The previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to
considertheformattingofpromptsusedforactualevaluation. Incontrast,weinsteadmatchontokenized
input,beingcarefultopassfullyverbalizedevaluationsamplestothetokenizer. Wealsodivergefromthe
previous methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token
tobecontaminatedifitappearsinanytoken n-gramlongerthan10tokensinboththeevaluationsample
and the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens
contaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination
scales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with <20%contamination)
and a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with >80%contamination). In order to account for the
vagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small "skipgram budget" of four tokens, so
that matchedspans between anevaluation sampleand the trainingdata can differin at mostfour positions
(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).
We identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee
etal.(2022),modifiedtoworkonaPySparkcluster(effectivelywithoutrandomaccesstodisk). Giventhe
embarrassinglyparallelnatureofthetask,weareabletofindallsuch10-grams(andtheirfulllengths)in
our entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.
As there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has
contributedtoevaluationperformance(mostlystemmingfromthefactthat"clean"and"dirty"subsetsdo
not necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event
of dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the "cleanest" examples to
haveanoverall worseaveragescorethantheircomplement,andthe"dirtiest"samplestohaveanoverall better
average score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were
true. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:
•“Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,
•“Not clean” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,
•“Not dirty” samples, with less than 80% token contamination,
•“Dirty”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.

Table 51: Contamination analysis results for affected datasets. No other evaluation datasets had sufficient
evidence to be considered affected by contamination. Avg. Contam. % denotes the average per-sample
contamination percentage for the given subset type. Models sizes refer to pretrained-only models
may appear contaminated, by virtue of many tokens appearing in matched sequences found in the training
data. However, the matched sequences might be highly fragmented across the training data, in which case it
is very unlikely the model saw the correctly-assembled contaminated sequences during training. To reduce
the chance of this phenomenon, we repeat our analysis with minimum match length L∈ {10,20,30,40,50}.
Sinceinthelimitof L→ ∞everysamplefallsintoboththe"clean"and"notdirty"(thereisnocontamination),
we report the largest Lfor each dataset that appeared to benefit from contamination to strike a balance
between fragmentation and overall contamination.

Hardware and Software (Section 2.2)
Training Factors We usedcustomtraininglibraries, Meta’sResearchSuperCluster, andproduc-
tionclustersforpretraining. Fine-tuning,annotation,andevaluationwerealso
performed on third-party cloud compute.
Carbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware
of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539
tCO 2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.
Training Data (Sections 2.1 and 3)
Overview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available
sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as
wellasoveronemillionnewhuman-annotatedexamples. Neitherthepretraining
nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.
Data Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is
more recent, up to July 2023.
Evaluation Results
See evaluations for pretraining (Section 2); fine-tuning (Section 3); and safety (Section 4).
Ethical Considerations and Limitations (Section 5.2)
Llama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in
English, and has notcovered, nor could it coverall scenarios. For these reasons, aswith all LLMs,
Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances
produceinaccurateorobjectionableresponsestouserprompts. Therefore,beforedeployingany
applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their
specific applications of the model. Please see the Responsible Use Guide available available at
